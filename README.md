## Problem Title
 Smart Cities and Infrastructure
## Problem Description
Smart cities aim to integrate various aspects of urban life — including transportation, energy, water, healthcare, security, and waste management — using advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, cloud computing, and automation. The goal is to create urban environments that are not only more efficient but also more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient.Smart cities represent a new approach to managing these challenges, using technology and data-driven solutions to improve the sustainability, efficiency, and livability of urban areas.According to the United Nations, more than 55% of the global population lives in cities, and this number is expected to rise to 68% by 2050. This shift toward urban living is creating significant challenges in terms of infrastructure, resource management, and quality of life.

## Idea
1.Intelligent Traffic Management: Use sensors and AI to monitor traffic patterns, optimize signal timings, and reduce congestion.
2.Electric Vehicles (EVs): Promote the adoption of EVs through charging stations, incentives, and infrastructure development.
3.Autonomous Public Transport: Implement autonomous buses or vehicles for efficient, on-demand public transport services.
4.Smart Parking Systems: Use sensors and apps to find available parking spaces in real time, reducing traffic and pollution.
5.Smart Waste Collection: Implement IoT-enabled waste bins that monitor trash levels and optimize collection routes to reduce traffic and pollution.
6.Smart Water Meters: Use sensors to detect leaks, monitor water consumption, and ensure efficient water usage in both residential and commercial areas.
7.Smart Policing: Integrate data analytics to optimize policing strategies, crime prediction, and resource allocation.
